            Hi! I love creating small application of any kind that I can think of. My creativity is always at work
             and is the reason why I have been able to create all the little projects I've made so far.
              My main goal is to continue learning and growing as a developer,
               so that I can bring my best to the projects I work on.

          <p>
            I am a programming student with a strong passion for web
            development, particularly in frontend design and user interface
            creation. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, interactive,
            and visually appealing designs. In my free time, I dive into the
            world of video games and anime, which often spark creative
            inspiration for my projects. Combining my technical skills with my
            hobbies allows me to approach development with a fresh and
            innovative perspective. My goal is to continue growing as a
            developer and contribute to projects that merge functionality with
            creativity.
