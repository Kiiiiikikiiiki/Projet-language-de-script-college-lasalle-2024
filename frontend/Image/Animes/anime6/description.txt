In a world where most of the population is born with a Quirk, an extraordinary ability that is different for each person, it was not long before both villains and heroes appeared, ready to stop them. Over time, heroes became government officials, regulated and living off their work, as well as becoming the object of admiration of many. Now, being a hero is the dream of the vast majority of children, who wait from a very young age for their Quirk to manifest so they can begin training and dream of becoming the number one heroes.
